This path will be defined according to that channel.

* BS Grewal is the best resource to practice questions. Most of the
  questions in Exams and quizzes are taken from the solved examples of BS
  Grewal. That is going to be the bible for us in AOD.
* Apart from BS Grewal, if you want concise material, you can look up
  the notes by prof. Phaneedra T. Almost all teachers upload his slides
  because they are that good. His slides/pdf will come in really handy
  before exams for quick revision.
